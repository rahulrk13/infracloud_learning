Assignment 9:
Deploy a Pod which uses a service account. The pod tries to use a configmap. Setup RBAC for the service account such that the service account does not have access to the configmap resource.


Solution:

Service account are feature provided by Kubernetes which helps provided/restrict user access to specific cluster.
RBAC: Role based access control is a mechanism with which we can make sure the access is provided based on user roles or groups and not directly to user. 

Authorization in Kubernetes is additive, which means we can't specify a deny rule. 

So to achieve the task in this assignment, first we will provide a role to SA, and check if it works, then we will keep the SA and remove the role and see what changes it does.

Screenshots:
ss1: shows all created resource
ss2: Shows we are able to list the configmap from within the pod when Cluster role is attached to Service account
ss3: Shows when we delete the Binding, service role is there but now it doesnâ€™t have RBAC provided access, so it throws forbidden error
