Assignment 2 steps

- Run a Pod on each node of the kubernetes cluster. (Say 3 nodes)

Solution:

We can achieve this by using daemonset object for defining pod, which will schedule one pod per node

yaml will be as follows:

assignment_2_daemonset.yaml

This query will help to find pod and node details

kubectl get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,STATUS:.status.phase,NODE:.spec.nodeName

Screenshot:
ss1 shows node and pod details each node has only one pod
