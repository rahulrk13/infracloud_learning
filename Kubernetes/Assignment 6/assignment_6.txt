Assignment 6.
Deploy a Pod with multiple containers, one of the container creates random files, and the other list the contents of the created file.

Solution:
This can be achieved with Deployment /pod specification which will have shared volumes (scratch or persistent volumes). As the volume is shared between the containers, files written by one container will be readable by another container.



files:

assignment_6_pod.yaml
