Assignment 8:  Deploy a pod which uses the nginx reverse proxy configuration from a configmap

Solution:
Referred this page https://www.keycdn.com/support/nginx-reverse-proxy.
To set up reverse-proxy, we need to create file named 'reverse-proxy.conf' in the directory '/etc/nginx/sites-available', which will have below config.

server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.x.x.2;
    }
}

files:

assignment_8_deployment.yaml
assignment_8_config_map.yaml
assignment_8_service.yaml

Screenshots:

ss1: service, configmap and deployment are created
ss2: shows that the settings was applied successfully with configmap
