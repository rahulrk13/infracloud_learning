Assignment 5:

Write a Python program to expose Prometheus metrics using the Python client

Script file name: assignment5.py

Steps:

1. Wrote a script which exposes 2 metrics using Python's Flask library
Counter: python_total_invocation - Number of times the endpoint was invoked
Histogram: python_request_duration_seconds - Number of seconds the wait counter was ran for.

Basic Idea: Script has 2 endpoints:
1: /
 which just shows a hello message, but waits for some seconds in range of 1 to 10. Counter metrics will increase each time the request is made and the Histogram metrics has some pre-defined buckets in which it will store the data for sleep timer seconds
2: /metrics
which will show the metrics collected.

We will then configure prometheus to monitor this app and search for the metrics we added with this script.

Screenshots:

ss3. Shows Generated metrics
ss4. Shows the new metrics are searchable
