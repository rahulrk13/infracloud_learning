Assignment 2:
Install Prometheus using Helm & access Prometheus using kubectl port-forward.

Installed using below stapes

Create service role and role binding for Helm

assignment2_serviceacc.yaml

Download helm installed script:
wget https://github.io/get_helm.sh

Install helm
bash get_helm.sh

Init helm:
helm init --service-account helm

To verify if the tiller component is installed, run below command
kubectl get svc, deploy -n kube-system

Install prometheus using helm
helm install stable/prometheus

command for port-forwarding
kubectl --namespace default port-forward <generated_pod_name> 9091

in my case
kubectl --namespace default port-forward exciting-gopher-prometheus-pushgateway-78b567cc7c-f4qp2 9091

However I was not able to get the correct IP in GKE with ifconfig so had to change the service to LB type and access the prometheus on internet. 

kubectl edit svc exciting-gopher-prometheus-server
Change the service type to LB and save the change, the changes take place immediately
